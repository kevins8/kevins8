# Losing My Luggage in Nepal

- tagline
    - you know that feeling when you show up in Nepal to go trekking for two weeks and realize that all your equipment is gone?
- story of losing my luggage
- my reaction in the past
    - in the past, "why me" attitude
    - world is not fair but no one likes it when its not fair to them
- my reaction today
    - i made a joke
    - we spent extra days in kathmandu (bad idea)
    - when we both couldn't take it, went on trip outside of city
- overview of trip in nepal
    - bhaktapur and dukal
    - earthquake
    - homestay
- recap of events
    - go back to kathmandu
    - luggage not there
    - buy everything again

- insight about life
    - you don't know what's going to happen
    - you can plan for the worst case
    - don't freak out
    - focus on what is important
- fallout from event
    - we had to trek a little faster
    - cough from nepal
    - had some tough conversations
    - spent $183 buying "new" trekking equipment
    - world didn't end
    - backpack smells like rotting fruit

- takeaways
    - life isn't fair and stuff happens, deal with solution not the problem
    - learn from mistakes: airline checkin is important, always look for changes in flight
    - contigency plans: if my luggage doesn't show up...
    - don't put cash in checked in pack
    - don't put fruit in checked in pack
- conclusion
    - nepal trek was successful
    - friend was married
    - trying to not be cought with my luggage gone in 2016
    - focus on details but not be caught up in them: there a some life milestones I want to hit this year
    - but if I did, I can handle it
    - can always go to nepal and buy everything

    - paying attention to details
    - airline checked bags, pay attention
    - continue refining my decision making process

# Next
- why I had money in my bag
- describe the mising luggage area in kathmandu.

# Parts
I like to say that I use a greedy algorithm to make decisions. Greedy
algorithms, when faced with a problem, will make the optimal local
decision at every decision point. The keyword is local - a greedy
algorithm will fail horribly if it starts on the wrong track. It doesn't
take into account previous context. In the worst case, it will never come
close to the global optimal situation.

# Outline
- back in day, known to be impulsive
    - bike to austin
    - go on adventures
    - do things on a whim
    - local optimality

- now i'm more dynamic
    - don't make same mistake twice

- time is important
    - attention is important

- can't predict future
    - plan for worst case
    - prepare

- made many mistakes in the past
    - will use lessons moving forward

- recognize
    - life is unpredictable
    - time is short
    - focus on what is important
    - don't freak out
    - why is this happening to me?

- i think i reacted alright
    - made light of it
    - spent extra day in kathmandu
    - friend was good about it
    - made side trips to bhaktapur and nagarkot
    - dhuka square destroyed
    - donate money
    - hotel destroyed
    - person wants to start his own homestay

- nepal is going through a bad time
    - earthquake
    - india
    - but people are still good

- so for me
    - i'm still okay
    - my luggage wasn't there, I got new ones
    - problem with money is not a problem (advice they never follow)
    - there are many actual problems
        - in the world but I'm not talking about those
        - my own problems: dying alone, insecurity, etc

- what i'm taking away from this
    - its time for me to be more analytical
    - chess like
    - thing of plans
    - good skill to think on your feet
    - best battle is one not fought
    - best recovery is something you have a plan for

- taking lessons from past years
    - putting them to use in 2016


# Research
- algo
    - greedy: choose local optimal solution every time
    - dynamic:
        - break down complex problem into simplier sub problems and indexing solution (memoization), each time a subproblem is encountered again, algo first tries to reuse existing solution
            - break down is recursive
    - divide and conquer
    - map/reduce
